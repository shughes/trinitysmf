Anyway, here are the things we talked about:

1) no "friends" (but each person can have the option of info privacy)
2) general message board
3) announcements/job opportunity section
4) wall vs. message (I think we decided on both for now, but that the wall should be designated as friendly chat versus professional message postings)
5) email notifications when a message is sent (not a wall note)
6) search options by all categories
7) Upload: picture(s), resume(s), cover letter(s)
8) Profile info:
    - name 
    - graduation year from TU
    - employer
    - job title
    - location
    - email address
    - telephone number
    - past employers
    
So, overall it should be professional looking - it can be colorful and creative but professional.  I trust your judgment!  Also, about a title, SMF Network would work... or if you have any ideas that'd be great too.
 
Just let me know if you can't get on the Trinity server so that I can tell my professor about the monthly costs.  You can email me at any point if you have any questions whatsoever.  If you want to meet again too we can do that.
 
Oh - and feel free to "advertise" yourself... even make a link somewhere to your contact information or something.  I don't know if you were planning on doing that, but I think it's a good idea!
 
Take care and enjoy your Spring Break!
