=== Trinity SMF Social Network

This is a project I developed in 2006. It's a social network for Trinity Student Managed
Funds Business students and alumni, developed in Rails. It allows for current students to
communicate with other students and alumni. They can:

* exchange resumes
* post public stock market advice
* post public job opportunities
* send private messages to other users
* create personal profiles
* search profiles
* receive stock quotes
* write messages on other user profiles
* etc...

A demo version is located here: http://demo.trinitysmf.net.
